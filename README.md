# Clinical-Data-Analysis-Portfolio-Project
This repository presents a portfolio project simulating the role of a data analyst in clinical data management.   It is based on a **mock Phase II clinical trial dataset** (treatment vs placebo group).  
# Clinical Data Analysis Portfolio Project

The goal is to demonstrate:
- How to clean and validate clinical trial data.
- How to anticipate and manage **protocol amendments**.
- How to ensure **data integrity, auditability, and reproducibility**.
- How to deliver actionable **statistical insights and professional reports** to clients.

## üî¨ Project Workflow

1. **Data Cleaning & Validation**  
   - Handling missing values, duplicate entries, and protocol deviations.    

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Patient demographics, treatment group balance, outcome distributions.  
   - Visualizations in Python (matplotlib, seaborn, pandas).  

3. **Statistical Analysis**  
   - Comparison of treatment vs placebo outcomes.  
   - Survival analysis & hypothesis testing.  

4. **Reporting**  
   - Professional report for stakeholders (PDF included in `/reports`).  
   - Clear communication of results, methodology, and limitations.

## üìä Tools & Libraries
- Python: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, lifelines
- R (optional): survival analysis, ggplot2
- Report writing: reportlab, LaTeX-style formatting
